If you want to level up from a junior
developer to a senior engineer or land a
high paying job at a big tech company,
you need to learn system design. But
where do you start? To master system
design, you first need to understand the
core concepts and fundamental building
blocks that come up when designing real
world systems or tackling system design
interview questions. In this video, I
will break down the 30 most important
system design concepts you need to know.
Learning these concepts helped me land
high paying offers from multiple big
tech companies. And in my 8 years as a
software engineer, I've seen them used
repeatedly when building and scaling
large scale systems. Let's get started.
Almost every web application that you
use is built on this simple yet powerful
concept called client server
architecture. Here is how it works. On
one side, you have a client. This could
be a web browser, a mobile app or any
other frontend application. And on the
other side, you have a server, a machine
that runs continuously waiting to handle
incoming request. The client sends a
request to store, retrieve or modify
data. The server receives the request,
processes it, performs the necessary
operations, and sends back a response.
This sounds simple, right? But there is
a big question. How does the client even
know where to find a server? A client
doesn't magically know where a server
is. It needs an address to locate and
communicate with it. On the internet,
computers identify each other using IP
addresses, which works like phone
numbers for servers. Every publicly
deployed server has a unique IP address.
Something like this. When a client wants
to interact with a service, it must send
request to the correct IP address. But
there's a problem. When we visit a
website, we don't type its IP address.
We just enter the website name. Right?
Instead of relying on hard to remember
IP addresses, we use something much more
human friendly, domain names. But we
need a way to map a domain name to its
corresponding IP address. This is where
DNS or domain name system comes in. It
maps easy to remember domain names like
algo masteraster.io io to their
corresponding IP addresses. When you
type algo masteraster.io into your
browser, your computer asks a DNS server
for the corresponding IP address. Once
the DNS server responds with the IP,
your browser uses it to establish a
connection with the server and make a
request. You can find the IP address of
any domain name using the ping command.
When you visit a website, your request
doesn't always go directly to the
server. Sometimes it passes through a
proxy or reverse proxy first. A proxy
server acts as a middleman between your
device and the internet. When you
request a web page, the proxy forwards
your request to the target server,
retrieves the response, and sends it
back to you. A proxy server hides your
IP address, keeping your location and
identity private. A reverse proxy works
the other way around. It intercepts the
client request and forwards them to the
back end server based on predefined
rules. Whenever a client communicates
with a server, there is always some
delay. One of the biggest cause of this
delay is physical distance. For example,
if our server is in New York, but a user
in India sends a request, the data has
to travel halfway across the world and
then the response has to make the same
long trip back. This roundtrip delay is
called latency. High latency can make
applications feel slow and unresponsive.
One way to reduce latency is by
deploying our service across multiple
data centers worldwide. This way, users
can connect to the nearest server
instead of waiting for data to travel
across the globe. Once a connection is
made, how do clients and servers
actually communicate? Every time you
visit a website, your browser and the
server communicate using a set of rules
called HTTP. That's why most URLs is
start with HTTP or it secure version
HTTPS. The client sends a request to the
server. This request includes a header
containing details like the request
type, browser type, and cookies and
sometimes a request body which carries
additional data like form inputs. The
server processes the request and
responds with an HTTP response either
returning the requested data or an error
message if something goes wrong. HTTP
has a major security flaw. It sends data
in plain text. Modern websites use
HTTPS. HTTPS encrypts all data using SSL
or TLS protocol ensuring that even if
someone intercepts the request, they
can't read or alter it. But clients and
servers don't directly exchange raw HTTP
requests and response. HTTP is just a
protocol for transferring data, but it
doesn't define how requests should be
structured, what format responses should
be in, or how different clients should
interact with the server. This is where
APIs or application programming
interfaces come in. Think of an API as a
middleman that allows clients to
communicate with servers without
worrying about low-level details. A
client sends a request to an API. The
API hosted on a server processes the
request, interacts with databases or
other services, and prepares a response.
The API sends back the response in a
structured format, usually JSON or XML,
which the client understands and can
display. There are different API styles
to serve different needs. Two of the
most popular ones are REST and GraphQL.
Just a quick note to keep this video
concise, I'm covering these topics at a
high level, but if you want to go deeper
and learn these topics in more detail,
check out my blog at
blog.algammaster.io. Every week I
publish in-depth articles on complex
system design topics with clear
explanations and real world examples.
Make sure to subscribe so that you don't
miss my new articles. Among the
different API styles, REST is the most
widely used. A REST API follows a set of
rules that defines how clients and
servers communicate over HTTP in a
structured way. REST is stateless. Every
request is independent. Everything is
created as a resource. For example,
users, orders, products. It uses
standard HTTP methods like get to
retrieve data, post to create new data,
put to update existing data, and delete
to remove data. Rest APIs are great
because they are simple, scalable, and
easy to cast, but they have limitations,
especially when dealing with complex
data retrieval. REST endpoints often
return more data than needed, leading to
inefficient network uses. To address
these challenges, GraphQL was introduced
in 2015 by Facebook. Unlike REST,
GraphQL lets client ask for exactly what
they need. Nothing more, nothing less.
With a REST API, if you need a user's
profile along with their recent post,
you might have to make multiple requests
to different endpoints. With GraphQL,
you can combine those requests into one
and fetch exactly the data you need in a
single query. The server responds with
only the requested fields. However,
GraphQL also comes with trade-offs. It
requires more processing on the server
side, and it isn't as easy to cast as
REST. Now when a client makes a request
they usually want to store or retrieve
data. But this brings up another
question where is the actual data
stored. If our application deals with
small amounts of data we could store it
as a variable or as a file and load it
in memory. But modern applications
handle massive volumes of data far more
than what memory can efficiently handle.
That's why we need a dedicated server
for storing and managing data. A
database. A database is the backbone of
any modern application. It ensures that
data is stored, retrieved and managed
efficiently while keeping it secure,
consistent and durable. When a client
request to store or retrieve data, the
server communicates with the database,
fetches the required information and
returns it to the client. But not all
databases are the same. In system
design, we typically choose between SQL
and NoSQL databases. SQL databases store
data in tables with a strict predefined
schema and they follow ACIT properties.
Because of these guarantees, SQL
databases are ideal for applications
that require strong consistency and
structured relationships such as banking
systems. NoSQL databases on the other
hand are designed for high scalability
and performance. They don't require a
fixed schema and use different data
models including key value stores,
document stores, graph databases, and
wide column stores which are optimized
for large scale distributed data. So,
which one should you use? If you need
structured relational data with a strong
consistency, SQL is the better choice.
If you need high scalability, flexible
schema, NoSQL is the better choice. Many
modern applications use both SQL and
NoSQL together. As our user base grows,
so does the number of requests hitting
our application servers. One of the
quickest solutions is to upgrade the
existing server by adding more CPU, RAM
or storage. This approach is called
vertical scaling or scaling up which
makes a single machine more powerful.
But there are some major limitations
with this approach. You can't keep
upgrading a server forever. Every
machine has a maximum capacity. More
powerful servers become exponentially
more expensive. If this one server
crashes, the entire system goes down.
So, while vertical scaling is a quick
fix, it's not a long-term solution for
handling high traffic and ensuring
system reliability. Let's look at a
better approach, one that makes our
system more scalable and fall tolerant.
Instead of upgrading a single server,
what if we add more servers to share the
load? This approach is called horizontal
scaling or scaling out where we
distribute the workload across multiple
machines. More servers is equal to more
capacity which means the system can
handle increasing traffic more
effectively. If one server goes down,
others can take over which improves
reliability. But horizontal scaling
introduces a new challenge. How do
clients know which server to connect to?
This is where a load balancer comes in.
A load balancer sits between clients and
backend servers acting as a traffic
manager that distributes request across
multiple servers. If one server crashes,
the load balancer automatically
redirects traffic to another healthy
server. But how does a load balancer
decide which server should handle the
next request? It is a load balancing
algorithm such as roundroin, least
connections and IP hashing. So far we
have talked about scaling our
application servers. But as traffic
grows, the volume of data also
increases. At first we can scale a
database vertically by adding more CPU,
RAM and storage similar to application
servers. But there is a limit of how
much a single machine can handle. So
let's explore other database scaling
techniques that can help manage large
volumes of data efficiently. One of the
quickest and most effective ways to
speed up database read queries is
indexing. Think of it like the index
page at the back of a book. Instead of
flipping through every page, you jump
directly to the relevant section. A
database index works the same way. It's
a super efficient lookup table that
helps the database quickly locate the
required data without scanning the
entire table. An index is stores column
values along with pointers to actual
data rows in the table. Indexes are
typically created on columns that are
frequently queried such as primary keys,
foreign keys, and columns frequently
used in rare conditions. While indexes
speed up reads, they slow down rights
since the index needs to be updated
whenever data changes. That's why we
should only index the most frequently
accessed columns. Indexing can
significantly improve read performance.
But what if even indexing isn't enough
and our single database server can't
handle the growing number of read
request? That's where our next database
scaling technique, replication, comes
in. Just like we added more application
servers to handle increasing traffic, we
can scale our database by creating
copies of it across multiple servers.
Here is how it works. We have one
primary database also called the primary
replica that handles all write
operations. We have multiple read
replicas that handle read queries.
Whenever data is written to primary
database, it gets copied to read
replicas so that they stay in sync.
Replication improves the read
performance since read requests are
spread across multiple replicas reducing
the load on each one. This also improves
availability since if the primary
replica fails, a read replica can take
over as the new primary. Replication is
great for scaling read heavy
applications. But what do we need to
scale right operations or store huge
amounts of data? Let's say our service
became popular. It now has millions of
users and our database has grown to
terabytes of data. A single database
server will eventually struggle to
handle all this data efficiently.
Instead of keeping everything in one
place, we split the database into
smaller, more manageable pieces and
distribute them across multiple servers.
This technique is called sarding. Here
is how it works. We divide the database
into smaller parts called Sards. Each
sard contains a subset of the total
data. Data is distributed based on the
sarding key. For example, user ID. By
distributing data this way, we reduce
database load since each SA handles only
a portion of queries and speed of read
and write performance since queries are
distributed across multiple SS instead
of hitting a single database. Singing is
also referred to as horizontal
partitioning since it splits data by
rows. But what if the issue isn't the
number of rows but rather the number of
columns? In such cases, we use vertical
partitioning where we split the database
by columns. Imagine we have a user table
that stores profile details, login
history, and billing information. As
this table grows, queries become slower
because the table must scan many columns
even when a request only needs a few
specific fields. To optimize this, we
use vertical partitioning where we split
user table into smaller, more focused
tables based on users patterns. This
improves query performance since each
request only scans relevant columns
instead of the entire table. It also
reduces unnecessary disk IO making data
retrieval quicker. However, no matter
how much we optimize the database,
retrieving data from disk is always
slower than retrieving it from memory.
What if we could store frequently access
data in memory? This is called caching.
Caching is used to optimize the
performance of a system by storing
frequently access data in memory instead
of repeatedly fetching it from database.
One of the most common caching
strategies is the cash aside pattern.
Here is how it works. When a user
requests the data, the application first
checks the C. If the data is in the
cache, it's returned instantly avoiding
a database call. If the data is not in
the C, the application retrieves it from
the database. It stores it in the C for
future request and returns it to the
user. Next time the same data is
requested, it's served directly from C,
making the request much faster. To
prevent outdated data from being served,
we use time to live value or TTL. Let's
look at next database scaling technique.
Most relational database use
normalization to store data efficiently
by breaking it into separate tables.
While this reduces redundancy, it also
introduces joins. When retrieving data
from multiple tables, the data must
combine them using join operations,
which can slow down queries as the data
set grows. Denormalization reduces the
number of joints by combining related
data into a single table, even if it
means some data gets duplicated. For
example, instead of keeping users and
orders in a separate table, we create
user orders table that stores user
details along with the latest orders.
Now, when retrieving a user's order
history, we don't need a join operation.
The data is already stored together
leading to faster queries and better
read performance. Denormalization is
often used in read heavy applications
where speed is more critical. But the
downside is it leads to increased
storage and more complex update request.
As we scale our system across multiple
servers, databases and data centers, we
enter the world of distributed systems.
One of the fundamental principles of
distributed systems is the cap theorem
which states that no distributed system
can achieve all three of the following
at the same time. Consistency,
availability, and partition tolerance.
Since network failures are inevitable,
we must choose between consistency plus
partition tolerance or availability plus
partition tolerance. If you want to
learn about cap theorem in more detail,
you can check out this article on my
blog called Cap theorem explained. Most
modern applications don't just store
text record. They also need to handle
images, videos, PDFs, and other large
files. Traditional databases are not
designed to store large unstructured
files efficiently. So, what's the
solution? We use blob storage like
Amazon S3. Blobs are like individual
files like images, videos, or documents.
These blobs are stored inside logical
containers or buckets in the cloud. Each
file gets a unique URL making it easy to
retrieve and serve over the web. There
are several advantages with using blob
storage like scalability, pay as you go
model, automatic replication, easy
access. A common use case is to stream
audio or video files to user
applications in real time. But streaming
the video file directly from blob
storage can be slow, especially if the
data is stored in a distant location.
For example, imagine you are in India
trying to watch a YouTube video that's
hosted on a server in California. Since
the video data has to travel across the
world, this could lead to buffering and
slow load times. A content delivery
network or CDN solves this problem by
delivering content faster to users based
on their location. A CDN is a global
network of distributed servers that work
together to deliver web content like
HTML pages, JavaScript files, images,
and videos to users based on their
geographic location. Since content is
served from the closest CDN server,
users experience faster load times with
minimal buffering. Let's move to the
next system design concept which can
help us build realtime applications.
Most web applications use HTTP which
follows a request response model. The
client sends a request. The server
processes the request and sends a
response. If the client needs new data,
it must send another request. This works
fine for static web pages but it's too
slow and inefficient for real-time
applications like live chat
applications, stock market dashboards or
online multiplayer games. With HTTP, the
only way to get real-time update is
through frequent polling, sending
repeated request every few seconds. But
polling is inefficient because it
increases the server load and waste
bandwidth. As most responses are empty
when there is no new data, webockets
solve this problem by allowing
continuous two-way communication between
the client and the server over a single
persistent connection. The client
initiates a websocket connection with
the server. Once established, the
connection remains open. The server can
push updates to the client at any time
without waiting for a request. The
client can also send messages instantly
to the server. This enables real-time
interactions and eliminates the need for
polling. Webockets enables real-time
communication between a client and a
server. But what if a server needs to
notify another server when an event
occurs? For example, when a user makes a
payment, the payment gateway needs to
notify your application instantly.
Instead of constantly pulling an API to
check if an event has occurred, web
hooks allow a server to send an HTTP
request to another server as soon as the
event occurs. Here is how it works. The
receiver, for example, your app
registers a web hook URL with the
provider. When an event occurs, the
provider sends a HTTP post request to
the web hook URL with event details.
This saves server resources and reduces
unnecessary API calls. Traditionally
applications were built using a
monolithic architecture where all
features are inside one large codebase.
This setup works fine for small
applications but for large scale systems
monoliths become hard to manage, scale
and deploy. The solution is to break
down your application into smaller
independent services called
microservices that work together. Each
microser handles a single responsibility
has its own database and logic so it can
scale independently. communicates with
other microservices using APIs or
message cues. This way, services can be
scared and deployed individually without
affecting the entire system. However,
when multiple microservices need to
communicate, direct API calls aren't
always efficient. This is where message
cues come in. Synchronous communication,
for example, waiting for immediate
responses doesn't scale well. A message
Q enables services to communicate
asynchronously, allowing requests to be
processed without blocking other
operations. Here is how it works. There
is a producer which places a message in
the queue. The queue temporarily host
the message. The consumer retrieves the
message and processes it. Using message
cues, we can decouple services and
improve the scalability and we can
prevent overload on internal services
within our system. But how do we prevent
overload for the public APIs and
services that we deploy? For that we use
rate limiting. Imagine a bot starts
making thousands of requests per second
to your website. Without restrictions,
this could crash your servers by
consuming all available resources and
degrade performance for legitimate
users. Rate limiting restricts the
number of requests a client can send
within a specific time frame. Every user
or IP address is assigned a request
kota, for example, 100 requests per
minute. If they exceed this limit, the
server blocks additional requests
temporarily and returns an error. There
are various rate limiting algorithms.
Some of the popular ones are fix window,
sliding window, and token bucket. We
don't need to implement our own rate
limiting system. This can be handled by
something called an API gateway. An API
gateway is a centralized service that
handles authentication, rate limiting,
logging, monitoring, request routing,
and much more. Imagine a
microservices-based application with
multiple services. Instead of exposing
each service directly, an API gateway
acts as a single entry point for all
client request. It routes the request to
the appropriate microser and the
response is sent back through the
gateway to the client. API gateway
simplifies API management and improves
the scalability and security. In
distributed systems, network failures
and service retries are common. If a
user accidentally refreshes a payment
page, the system might receive two
payment request instead of one. Adam
potency ensures that repeated request
produced the same result as if the
request was made only once. Here is how
it works. Each request is assigned a
unique ID. Before processing, the system
checks if the request has already been
handled. If yes, it ignores the
duplicate request. If no, it processes
the request normally. If you enjoyed
